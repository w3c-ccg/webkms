      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
Cryptographic authentication systems enable machines, individuals, and
organizations to more securely interact with one another. These systems often
use public-private key cryptography or encryption mechanisms in order to  manage
cryptographic material as well as operations utilizing that material. There are
a variety of these sorts of cryptographic systems in use today, sometimes
referred to as Key Management Systems. While many of these sorts of systems
exist, there is no common interface for accessing and using these systems.
      </p>
      <p>
The creation of a common interface for accessing Key Management Systems would
enable software to be written once to interact with these systems such that
systems with different implementations and properties could be switched
without affecting the client software that utilizes such systems. A common API
would shift the burden of interacting with each implementation to the vendors
of those systems, while eliminating the burden for application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
While there are a variety of proprietary enterprise grade Key Management Systems today
that would benefit from a common interface, personal Key Management Systems
such as those created through the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) initiative could
also benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
If the interface is provided as a Web-based interface, then Web-based
applications could be written against such an API. Similarly, Web-based
applications could provide choice in Key Management Systems -- potentially
allowing customers to bring their own Key Management Systems with them just as
they bring their own devices today.

        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where this specification is expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>controller</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by demonstrating control of
cryptographic key material in order to authenticate itself with a system.
          </dd>
          <dt>key management client</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by communicating with a Key Management
System.
          </dd>
          <dt>key management system</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by providing an interface to
the management of cryptographic material and the execution of cryptographic
operations.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
There is a relatively small set of common cryptographic operations that Key
Management Systems provide. These operations include: generate, wrap, unwrap,
sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt. These cryptographic operations can be
thought of as <em>functions</em> that operate on <em>objects</em>, in this case
cryptographic keys, in a remote execution environment.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
Ensure that the list is updated from
<a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/web-kms-switch/tree/http-sig/lib/schemas">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
The Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data [[ZCAP-LD]] specification,  also
know as ZCAPs, outlines how remote execution environments can be  manipulated by
demonstrating cryptographic control of  <em>functions</em> and <em>objects</em>.
The  ZCAP-LD specification enables one to grant authority to remote clients to
call functions on specific objects. This technology enables a Key Management
System to provide a Web-based API that enables clients to create keys and
execute cryptographic operations using those keys by invoking ZCAPs.
        </p>
        <p>
The WebKMS API enables clients to create keystores, a type of <em>object</em>,
that they control. That is, the client is the <a>controller</a> of the keystore.
The client may also generate a key, another type of <em>object</em>, and
associate it with a keystore. Each keystore is identified by a URI. In
addition, the controller of a keystore can be changed to enable the transfer
of keys without requiring the exfiltration of the key. Other entities can
also be added as controllers of the keystore such that multiple parties might
control the keystore without having access to the raw key material.
        </p>
        <p>
Each key in the keystore has an associated set of <em>functions</em> according
to the type of key that it is. Examples of key types include keys used for
performing asymmetric cryptographic operations such as digital signatures and
keys used for performing symmetric cryptographic operations such as
encryption and decryption. These <em>functions</em> can be remotely executed
via the use of ZCAPs such that the cryptographic key material never
needs to be exfiltrated in order to use the key. In many hardware-backed
cryptographic key management systems, the exfiltration of keys is not
supported and the system itself is hardened against tampering with the
intent to exfiltrate the keys.
        </p>
        <p>
In order to execute a <em>function</em> on a key, a <code>KmsOperation</code>
of a specific type can be applied to the key, including a ZCAP that
invokes the capability that demonstrates the authorization to perform the
operation. For example, a KmsOperation might be constructed and POSTed to
the key URL with an invocation of a ZCAP performed via HTTP Signatures.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

account when utilizing this data model.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.

This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
